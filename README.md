# Atlas News
A website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLAlchemy, and Flask for the [Bay Area Hacks Hackathon](https://bay-area-hacks-society.devpost.com)

Atlas News provides a unique user interface to access international news using the [newscatherAPI](https://newscatcherapi.com/). It offers the ability to create an account/login to leave comments on any article, and has an interactive map UI to find relevant news in specific regions of the world. This project's front-end was also built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, by using an SVG for the world-map. For more information, watch this [demo](https://youtu.be/g7aNs0qSqtE) video.
